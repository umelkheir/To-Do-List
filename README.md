# MY FINAL PROJECT
My project is a simple to do list that let's users add to do lists and add days and time in their to do item. 

- What does it do?  
  It tells the user how many days are remaining for their item that they've added, when the item is due, and if the item is overdue.

- What is the "new feature" which you have implemented that we haven't seen before?  
 It uses datetime module that let's the user add their date and time.
